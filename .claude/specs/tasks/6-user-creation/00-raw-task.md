Task 6 - Handle user creation on the backend

Description:
Currently when user logs in the app for the first time he gets the email with link to confirm the sign up and then user is created in Supabase. But I need to also save user data in the User table on the backend.

Approaches: 
Option 1 — Supabase Database Webhook (recommended)

Supabase can fire an HTTP POST to your NestJS backend whenever a row is inserted into auth.users. You configure this in the Supabase Dashboard under Database → Webhooks, pointing at e.g. POST /api/users/sync.

- Triggered automatically on first confirmed sign-in (when Supabase creates the auth user)
- No changes needed to frontend code
- Your NestJS endpoint receives the new user's id, email, etc. and does prisma.user.create(...)
- Also create the free Subscription row here atomically

Option 2 — "upsert on first authenticated request"

Add a NestJS guard or middleware that, after validating the Supabase JWT on any protected route, checks if a User row exists for that supabaseId and creates one if not.

- Lazy creation — user row appears on first real API call, not at sign-up
- Slightly more latency on the first request; also means User may not exist when you need it (e.g., a race with a webhook)
- Simpler to implement, no external webhook config needed

Use the Supabase webhook as the primary creation path, and add a lightweight upsert-if-missing check in your JWT guard as a fallback. This way you're never in a state where a valid Supabase session has no corresponding User row, regardless of how the user landed in the app.
